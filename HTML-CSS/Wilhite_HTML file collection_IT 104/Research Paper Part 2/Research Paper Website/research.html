		There’s a lot of research to be done in a few fields of Cybersecurity, such as strengthening encryption methods and developing protective measures for burgeoning, new technologies such as the brand new Quantum Computing field. 
		Given the state of the field at present, however, it is highly unlikely that cybersecurity will reach this field in the foreseeable future, given that complex creations have yet to be engineered on the principles of Quantum Computing.
