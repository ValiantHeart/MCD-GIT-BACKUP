		>This citation is a report published by the staff of Senator Edward Markey (D-Mass) published very recently in 2015. It provides in insight into how the concept of cybersecurity is being handled (or rather mishandled) by the automotive industry. It talks about the integration computers and wireless functionalities into cars with emphasis on the need for security. The authority of this publication would entirely depend on how trusting you are of government publications or how much validity senator Markey’s office and staff have. I’m using this document as a source for how current innovation trends are heading and how the need for cybersecurity is indicated for these fields.

The article was published on November 23rd, 2015 by Alexandra Ossola. The article speculates that online-enabled medical implants such as pacemakers and insulin pumps may become targets for cyber-attacks. Specifically, in the act of installing ransomware within these medical implants.  I use this article as a means for speculating the future need for security of medical devices.

This device, nicknamed a Blue Box, was used to hack into devices connected to a telecommunications network. Blue Box’s like these were commonplace in a phreaker’s toolkit during the 70’s and 80’s. Hence, it’s inclusion is historically relevant.
