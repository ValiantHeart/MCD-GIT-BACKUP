		The history of Hacking and Cybersecurity is an intertwined history with one giving rise to the other. 
		<li><ul>In a sense, Cybersecurity rose as a counter-phenomenon to Hacking.</ul></li> 
		In the 1960's, the term hacker was accepted as a positive label slapped onto computer gurus who could push computer systems beyond the defined limits."ù (Spyd3r, 2002) 
		Although, as time went on and the medium of computer science became more and more sophisticated and widespread, the term hacker became known as a negative term on the same order as criminal, or delinquent. 
		"In the 1970s, 'Captain Crunch' devised a way to make free long distance calls and groups of phone hackers, later dubbed 'phreakers' emerged." (Spyd3r, 2002) 
		The Captain Crunch incident is the most well-known of early uses of H/P culture becoming closely tied to negative and even criminal actions. 
		It is also the most well-known of the early uses of exploiting a glitch. 
		"During the 1980s, hacking was not known amongst the masses as it is presently. 
		To be a hacker was to be a part of a very exclusive and secluded group. The infamous hacker groups the 'Legion of Doom,' based in the USA and the 'Chaos Computer Club,'ù based in Germany, were founded and are still two of the most widely recognized and respected hacker groups ever founded." (Spyd3r, 2002) 
		"During the 1990s, Kevin Mitnick is arrested after being tracked down by Tsutomu Shimomura. The trials of Kevin Mitnick were of the most publicized hacker trials in hacker history. As hackers and time progressed, hackers found ways to exploit holes in operating systems of local and remote machines."ù (Spyd3r, 2002)

		During the 1970's and 1980's the internet experienced a population boom as more and more people were using it as a means of conducting business, recordkeeping, and communication. 
		It wasn't until the 1989 and the 1990's with the invention of dedicated internet access lines, i.e. Ethernet, and the .com revolution that the internet's device population entered a stage of unprecedented expansion that continues to this day. 
		The need for security has always been needed since personal or confidential data was uploaded to the internet. 
		With the invention of social media, blogs, YouTube, Skype, Online Banking, E-stores, and other countless web-dependent functions that handle personal data; the need for protection has become quite obvious.
