		Legal and Ethical Issues:
	</p>
	
	<p>
		There has been a lot of discussion of Cybersecurity and Hacking in terms of legality, especially in the last 20 to 25 years. 
		The discussion of legality about Cybersecurity can be narrowed into a single category in regards to what they’ve been about: The legality of data ownership. 
		On the subject of the first category, the subject of data ownership definitely has its origins in copyright and copyrighted content. 
		The most prominent piece of legislature that relates to both entertainment and cybersecurity is the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (DMCA). 
		The DMCA defines the ownership of digital content, whether it’s distributed online or in a physical data storage medium. 
		Numerous political and court rulings involving copyrighted content have been made with the DMCA as a base, including the most recent Viacom vs YouTube, Google case. 
		In this case, Viacom Incorporated accused YouTube and its parent company, Google, of engaging in a massive copyright infringement in the form of YouTube videos being allowed to be uploaded online. 
		They also alleged that the copyright infringements costed about 1.65 billion dollars in damages. (Broache, 2007) 
		The case was eventually settled using the DMCA’s “safe harbor” provisions which shields content owners and parent companies from suits regarding content ownership.  
	</p>
	
	<p>
		There are even more proposed laws in the House and the Senate that involve Cybersecurity. 
		They are as follow: The Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act of 2012 or CISPA (H.R. 3523), Cybersecurity Act of 2012 (S. 2105), The SECURE IT Act (S. 3342), and The Obama Administration Proposal. 
		CISPA would grant the director of national intelligence the ability to set up channels of information sharing with the Private Sector. 
		CISPA also would prevent any information provided by companies to be shared with any unwanted federal agencies. 
		It would also protect any information shared with the agencies from being used for commercial benefit. (CYBERSECURITY LEGISLATION: THE FINAL FOUR., 2012)
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Then there is the Cybersecurity Act of 2012 (S. 2105), which would be another measure for protection of shared data from companies with the federal government. 
		It would also call for the Department of Homeland Security to develop specific standards for exchanging information about cybersecurity threat and vulnerabilities with companies in the private sector. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
		“The SECURE IT Act, S. 3342, would establish cybersecurity intelligence sharing between the private sector and multiple centers throughout the federal government These centers must follow standards set by the secretaries of Commerce and Homeland Security to protect personal and trade information, and those providing information would be protected from legal reprisal or public disclosure of shared content. 
		Additional control is provided to the private sector, as those sharing information must provide consent before data may be shared with government. 
		Any shared knowledge may only be used for cybersecurity, national security, or law enforcement purposes.” (CYBERSECURITY LEGISLATION: THE FINAL FOUR., 2012)
	</p>
	
	<p>
		“This plan seeks to strike a compromise between the two competing Senate bills. 
		It assigns DHS the responsibility of carrying out cybersecurity information sharing. 
		Private-sector information used by the government must be related to cyber threats to federal networks or critical infrastructure, personal information must be protected from unauthorized access or disclosure, and those using federal networks must be notified that their traffic may be monitored. 
		Shared information may also be used for law enforcement purposes with the approval of the attorney general. 
		Cooperation with the federal government is protected from public disclosure.” (CYBERSECURITY LEGISLATION: THE FINAL FOUR., 2012)
