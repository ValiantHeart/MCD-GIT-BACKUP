		Introduction:
	</p>
	
	<p> 
		Cybersecurity and Hacking, Cybersecurity is the process whereby all internetworking-capable devices are secured and the act of preventing unauthorized users from accessing the devices, both physically and from the internet.
		Hacking is the inverse of cybersecurity where an unauthorized user gains access to a unit or system. 
		Cybersecurity as a profession is currently experiencing a massive boom in population, offered programs, and in importance.
		The National Security Agency has even called for an increase in the amount of Cybersecurity professionals in the industry, citing a shortage of capable professionals and a growing need for them.
		(Smith, 2012) Hacking has also experienced a similar boom in the number and types of hacking methods have increased dramatically in the past 3 decades.
		As the internet becomes bigger and bigger, and as more and more types of device become connected to the internet, the importance of Cybersecurity becomes greater exponentially.
		This paper will discuss the social, ethical, and legal ramifications of the act of Cybersecurity using evidence from real life sources when discussing how cyber security has developed.
		This paper will also use the hypothetical explorations of science fiction to discuss theoretical convergences of different fields of IT as they relate to cybersecurity in the future.
