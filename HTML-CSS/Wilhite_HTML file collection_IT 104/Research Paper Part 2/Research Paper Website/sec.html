		Security Issues:
	</p>
	
	<p>
		There are a number of currently pressing security concerns that currently exist in the field of Cybersecurity. 
		The most immediate of these concerns is the security problems facing the fields of medical technology, automotive technology, and that of the industrial networks.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The invention of the self-driving car has brought about both a stunning new innovation in the field of automotive engineering and a stunning conundrum in the field of Cybersecurity. 
		The automotive industry has not been very responsive to the need for a strong security system for their cars as Senator Edward Mackey’s report title” Tracking & Hacking: Security & Privacy Gaps Put American Driver’s at Risk” has pointed out. 
		“The encryption and security measures (response group 1) are not systems that can detect intrusion events. 
		Automobile security experts consulted by Senator Markey’s staff have noted that the ECU monitoring (response 2) described simply monitors the normal functioning of an ECU, the firewall/watchdog systems (response 3) would only protect against random outside influences like electromagnetic frequency interference and not malicious intrusions, the seed-key system (response 4) can be defeated by hackers, and the remote keyless entry systems (response 5) will only protect against people getting into the car to steal it but will do nothing to prevent or respond to remote hacking. 
		Also, only 1 of the systems, the seed-key system, is capable of alerting the manufacturer in real-time.” (Markey, 2015)  
		However, this negligence is compounded in a relatively recent article in a recent article published by Allyson Versprille in the National Defense Magazine revealed that it’s entirely possible that a hacker could penetrate into the control software for a self-driving car and cause it to crash or otherwise take control of the vehicle. 
		This security flaw could prove to be extremely dangerous or even fatal if used by an attacker. 
		They could exploit this access ability to potential kill or kidnap specific targets with their own vehicle. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Infrastructure networks are some of the most vulnerable networks that could have some of the most devastating consequences if hacked by an attacker. 
		Most industrial company networks are airgapped, which means the network has no physical connections to unsecure networks. 
		However, in the case of Industrial Networks, the real threat lies in physical security, in other words, an attacker could just walk into a plant and access the local control software and take control via a self-contained physical package and be able to control and monitor an entire facility from remote. 
		Most industrial networks are relatively unsecured once you get past the airgap. 
		This represents a very serious problem as the physical locations are sometimes entirely unprotected, or their protections are easily bypassed. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
		With the new innovation of the Stent Electrode or “Stentrode” for short. 
		This brand new technology has the greatest potential for disabled patients who wish to regain functionality of their limbs in the form of artificial and articulate prostheses that respond to commands from the brain, as if they were their own organic limbs. (Oxley, et al., 2016) 
		This technology has the potential to further the field of robotic prostheses greatly; while also providing a very serious and concerning potential threat to the personal security of those who use it. 
		It’s entirely feasible that someone could hack these devices, both the stentrodes and the prostheses themselves, and potentially use them to bring harm or to blackmail a user of these technologies. 
		Alexandra Ossola of Popular Science wrote about a similar example of hacking of pacemaker and the use of ransomware to force people to give a ransom to a hacker in exchange for not shutting down their medical implant. (Ossola, 2015)
