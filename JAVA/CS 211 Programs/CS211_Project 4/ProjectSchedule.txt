WORK ORDER::
(CIRCUIT):
  #then these:
   circuit_parseComponentLine_2

  #This should work once the constructor works:
   circuit_toString

  #make sure to finish creating constructor before testing/changing this:
   circuit_propagate2
   circuit_propagate9

  #these all rely on propagate working properly:
   circuit_read8
(GATE_SIM):
  #complete testing on CIRCUIT before decicding how to proceed with GATE_SIM....
