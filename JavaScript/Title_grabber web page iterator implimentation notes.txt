Implimentation notes:
 go to web page
 trigger the div element with id=continuations in ytd-playlist-video-list-renderer
   keep triggering the element till it has no daughter elements (no more elements to load into the list of videos)
 iterate through the ytd-playlist-video-list-renderer element for the tag: ytd-playlist-video-renderer <at this point it will have all the videos in the playlist>
   in each ytd-playlist-video-renderer element, search for the span element with the id "video-title"
   save each video title into an array/list
 once complete, output the amount of titles grabbed to the user/console, note how many were deleted, and how many were set to private.
 save information to file, place playlist title, titles grabbed, num of dels and privs at top followed by several
